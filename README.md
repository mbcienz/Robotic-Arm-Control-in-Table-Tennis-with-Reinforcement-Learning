# Robotic-Arm-Control-in-Table-Tennis-with-Reinforcement-Learning
This project aims to  develop and train a neural networks to control a robotic arm for playing table tennis in a simulated environment in PyBullet. The project employs supervised learning for inverse kinematics and reinforcement learning to optimize the robot’s paddle movements.
